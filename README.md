# Farm Bot Remote Control PCB

This repository contains the design files and documentation for a PCB created to control a Farm Bot vehicle. The PCB was designed for Funeda Pvt. Ltd. using EAGLE software, and the housing box for the remote was created using LaserCAD software.

## Project Overview

The Farm Bot Remote Control PCB is a custom-designed printed circuit board intended to facilitate the control of a Farm Bot vehicle. This remote control allows for efficient and precise management of the bot's movements and operations, enhancing agricultural automation.

## Features

- **Remote Control**: Designed to provide reliable control over the Farm Bot vehicle.
- **Custom PCB**: Created using EAGLE software to ensure optimal performance and functionality.
- **Laser-Cut Housing**: The remote's box is designed using LaserCAD software, providing a robust and precise enclosure.

## Software Used

- **EAGLE**: For designing the PCB layout and schematics.
- **LaserCAD**: For designing the housing box for the remote control.

## Files in This Repository

- `FarmBot.brd`: Contains the EAGLE design files for the PCB.
- `FarmBot.sch`: Includes the circuit schematics for the PCB.
- `05 schematic.png`: Image of the circuit schematic for quick reference.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
